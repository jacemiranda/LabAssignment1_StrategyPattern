1. [cite_start]**Knight**: Attacks with a sword; uses 3 strategies to defend (shield, dodge, magic barrier) [cite: 3]
2. [cite_start]**Wizard**: Casts spells; uses magic barrier to defend [cite: 4]
3. [cite_start]**Archer**: Shoots arrows; uses dodge to defend [cite: 5]

### [cite_start]A. DefenseStrategy [cite: 7]
1. [cite_start]Shield [cite: 8]
2. [cite_start]Dodge [cite: 9]
3. [cite_start]CreateMagic [cite: 10]

### [cite_start]B. AttackStrategy [cite: 11]
